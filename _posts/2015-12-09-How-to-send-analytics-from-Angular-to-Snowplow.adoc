# How to send analytics from Angular to Snowplow
:hp-tags: Analytics, Open Source, AngularJS, Development, Angulartics

A few days ago I released link:https://github.com/angulartics/angulartics-snowplow[angulartics-snowplow], an link:https://github.com/angulartics/angulartics[Angulartics] plugin to support link:http://snowplowanalytics.com/[Snowplow Analytics] pageview and structured event tracking.

I don't have an active Snowplow instance right now, but since the planned Segment->Snowplow integration has been on hold for a while, I thought I'd attempt an integration with Angulartics. If you use Snowplow Analytics we could use some help testing this integration.

There are some things left to do to flesh this out further (PRs welcomed!)
